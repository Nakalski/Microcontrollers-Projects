# Microcontrollers-Projects

Hey people! :)
  
Here i'll post some of my microcontroller projects that i've developed to a college class or simply built it 4fun.
Feel free to use if it has some use for you. If you developed something using this and want to put my name on it i will be happy, if not i won't be sad, because even the simplest of the knowledges is for everyone.


PS: if you have any question about the projects, and other stuff, send-me a e-mail i'll be happy to answer.
