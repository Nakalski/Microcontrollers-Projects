This is a project that i've developed to a class in college. Is a simple 4x4 RC Cart, well isn't really a 4x4 because i only had one motor driver
so i split the cart in two sides the left and the right one. you can check the schematics and codes on the files above.
As i said in the README on the master branch you can send me a email if you have a problem.

SORRY IF SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND VARIABLES ARE IN PORTUGUESE, MY PROFESSOR TOLD ME TO MADE DE ASSIGNMENT IN PORTUGUESE.
